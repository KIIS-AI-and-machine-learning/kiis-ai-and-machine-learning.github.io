### Day 5 Theme: TSMC Field Trip Presentations

#### Day 5 class

I have one major goal for today: To improve the upcoming presentations by giving you feedback. Note that the practice presentations themselves will be graded solely on participation, while the feedback given will be graded as homework based on the quality of the feedback.

For each of the five presentations, here is the prompt for all non-presenters. You will first write in your Fieldpad, and then you will share the feedback with the presenters via Google Classroom.
- **Prompt: Project presenter names:**
- **Topic - don't look this up, just listen to the presentation to figure it out.**
- **How effectively did the presenters communicate? Explain.**
- **In your opinion, what are some possible improvements for this project? Please make at least one substantive suggestion for the presenters. Be kind, and explain your suggestion.**
- **On a scale of 1 (super boring) to 10 (extremely interesting), how interesting was this project to you? What could the presenters do to make it more interesting?**

- Following **all of the presentations**, each team will read the feedback from the other students, discuss and summarize how you plan to use the suggestions, first writing in your Fieldpad, and then sharing your summary in Google Classroom. **Do NOT keep reading the feedback on your presentation while anyone else is presenting.** If you need to complete your response as homework, that is fine. It is also fine to use an AI tool to help your synthesize the feedback, just give it credit if you do so.

- ~~If time permits, we will watch [Naive Bayes, Clearly Explained!!!](https://youtu.be/O2L2Uv9pdDA?feature=shared)~~
  - ~~**Post-Presentations Prompt 1**: From this, describe Naive Bayes classification in your own words. How does it work? Explain.~~

- **Post-class reflection:** Reflect on the day’s activities and discussions in your Fieldpad. What did you learn? Explain.

#### Day 5: Homework

1. If you did not complete this in class, discuss and summarize how you plan to use the suggestions on your presentation.
1. Watch [Machine Learning Explained in 100 Seconds](https://youtu.be/PeMlggyqz0Y?feature=shared) and describe  what you learned from this short video.
1. Jump ahead in the Elements of AI textbook to [Elements of AI 4: Machine](https://course.elementsofai.com/4) and read the first two sections of the chapter, but do not answer any of the questions yet. We will work on this together in class next time.
1. Spend 20 minutes using [AI Tutor Pro](https://www.aitutorpro.ca/) to deepen your understanding of the material in chapter 4.
1. Write a reflection of several paragraphs in your Fieldpad about your experience using [AI Tutor Pro](https://www.aitutorpro.ca/).

---

## Day 4: June 10, 2025, 10:30-12:30, Room J417

### Day 4 Theme: The Math Behind AI

#### Day 4 class

- Discuss homework from Day 3:
  - How much time did you spend on the homework?
  - What did you think of the two AI tools I give you to try? What did you learn from using these tools?

- We have a couple of goals for today:
  - Complete at least 2 sections of chapter 3 in the Elements of AI textbook.
  - Start working on the field trip presentations for a week from Saturday.

#### Day 4: Field Work

- Probability is a key part of AI and it is not super-hard to understand. Probability is the chance of an event happening, expressed as a fraction, decimal, or percentage. For a fair six-sided die the **probability** of rolling any particular number like 3 is 1/6 ≈ 0.167 or 16.7%. **Odds** compare the number of ways something can happen versus the number of ways it can't happen. They're expressed as a ratio.
For rolling a 3, since there is 1 way to roll a 3 and 5 ways to not roll a 3
the Odds of rolling a 3 are 1:5. **Remember the following key points: Probability can be quantified and it can be right or wrong, but it is usually not possible to draw conclusions about whether a particular number like a weather forecast  probability was right or wrong based on a single observation, unless that probability is 0 or 1.**
  - **Prompt 1**: Explain why it is usually not possible to draw conclusions about whether a particular number was right or wrong based on a single observation, unless that probability is 0 or 1.

- Bayes Rule is a bit complicated because it is based on conditional probability, and you can just apply the formula, but it is better to understand it. Let's watch [What Is Bayes Theorem In AI? - The Friendly Statistician](https://youtu.be/JOVrcj4a1qc?feature=shared).
- Watch [seeing bayes theorem](https://youtu.be/jRHw_LfQFAY?feature=shared).
- A **conditional probability** is the probability of an event, given some other event has already occurred. Explore [Conditional probability](https://setosa.io/conditional/).
  - **Prompt 2**: Explain conditional probability in your own words. How is it different from regular probability? Give an example of a conditional probability in your own life. Did any of these help you understand Bayes Rule better? Explain.

- We might or might not finish chapter 3 today, but we will try to get through at least two sections. I want you to have time to work on the presentation.

- Don't forget to complete the post-class reflection in your Fieldpad. Reflect on the day’s activities and discussions. What did you learn? Explain.

#### Day 4: Homework

- On Saturday, June 21, we will take a field trip to TSMC in Hsinchu. It is a 30 minute bus ride, and working in teams of 2-3, you will be giving short 5-6 minute presentations while on the bus. The topics are below, and each team will have one assigned topic. You are expected to try out **multiple** different AI tools to help you with this research, and you will be reporting back to our class which of these tools proved most useful. The bullets under each group are just suggestions for what to include in your presentation. The presentation on the bus will count in the homework component of your grade, and you will give a couple of practice presenations in class that count in the participation component of your grade. **The first of these practice presentations will be tomorrow in class with an additional 1-2 minutes comparing and contrasting the different AI tools you used to help you with your research.** Your goal is to try to make an engaging presentation that will help your classmates understand the topic and its relevance to AI and Taiwan. A presentation on a bus is a difficult format, so try to think about how to make it engaging and interesting.

## Day 3: June 9, 2025, 10:30-12:30, Room J413

### Day 3 Theme: Search and Problem Solving

#### Day 3 class

- Discuss homework from Day 2:
  - How much time did you spend on the homework?
  - Let's show and tell with what you did with the AI tools you chose. What did you learn from using these tools?
  - What did you learn from the video on Large Language Models?
  - [Peer Instruction Day 2](https://runestone.academy/assignment/student/doAssignment?assignment_id=222691)

#### Day 3: Field Work

- My goal for today is to help you to better understand the basics of search and problem solving in AI, and to give you a chance to practice using an AI-generated tool to solve a problem. I am hoping we can finish chapter 2 of the Elements of AI textbook today, but we will see how it goes.

- I wanted to make it easier for you to solve the first problem in [Elements of AI: 2.1 Search and problem solving](https://course.elementsofai.com/2/1). So we will discuss it and then I will show you a tool that I used an AI to build... It took a LONG time because my prompt engineering wasn't great in retrospect and the AI kept making mistakes.

- Note that the Robot can only carry 1 item per trip, the Fox can't be alone with the Chicken, and the Chicken can't be alone with the Feed. Also note that N stands for Near and F stands for Far for each postion, while the items are positional with Robot=1 Fox=2 Chicken=3 Chicken-feed=4.
  - **Prompt 1**: What is the initial state of the problem? What is the goal state? Explain.

  - **Prompt 2**:  Identify some states in the state space that are not valid states. What are they? Explain.

  - **Prompt 3**: Identify some illegal transitions between valid states. What are they? Explain.

  - **Prompt 4**: Try to find the shortest path to the goal state using [Rowboat Puzzle: Find the Shortest Path](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/ba5fdd00-85d7-4c1d-8e6c-92e2bccdbed2)

- Continue working through [Elements of AI: 2.1 Search and problem solving](https://course.elementsofai.com/2/1), stopping each time you reach a question. Discuss the questions in your group, and when you reach consensus, have the questions graded. Then move on. Please let me know when you have finished the section. I can't share the chat directly because it uses advanced features, but I want to show it as best as I can so we can discuss it. See [Chat](https://docs.google.com/document/d/186xZNKUMNSMK6xeE38CcaIyGB-0JIl4DujzzAKzWNZE/edit?usp=sharing).
- **Prompt 5**: What mistakes did I make in my prompt engineering? How could I have done better? Explain.

- To better understand the Minimax algorithm, watch [Simple Explanation of the Minimax Algorithm with Tic-Tac-Toe](https://youtu.be/5y2a0Zhgq0U?feature=shared). This should help with [Elements of AI: 2.3 Search and Games](https://course.elementsofai.com/2/3).

- Please keep me posted on your progress in the Elements of AI textbook. I will be checking in with you to see how you are doing.

- **Post-class reflection:** How far did you get in the textbook? What did you learn today? Explain.

#### Day 3: Homework

1. Read the first part of [Odds and Probability](https://course.elementsofai.com/3/1) but don't answer any questions, instead just stop reading at the first question. We will work on this together in class next time. Discuss what you learned from this reading as well as any questions in your Fieldpad.

1. Play several rounds of [Quick Draw with Google](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/). Discuss your experience in your Fieldpad. What happened in each round? How did the AI do? What did you learn from this experience? What do you think the tool learned?

1. Play several rounds of [Google's Say What you See](https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/say-what-you-see/jwG3m7wQShZngw), which is a game that tries to help you with prompt engineering. Discuss your experience in your Fieldpad. What happened in each round? What did you learn from this experience?

- Working with your partner (s), return to the Elements of AI textbook and discuss the questions in [Elements of AI: 1.1 How should we define AI?](https://course.elementsofai.com/1/1), When you reach consensus, go ahead and have the questions graded.

- After finishing section, work through the rest of chapter 1, stopping each time you reach a question. Discuss the questions in your group, and when you reach consensus, have the questions graded. Then move on to section 2.1, read the whole section, and do the second part. (The first part is harder without paper - we will do it together on Monday.)
  - **Prompt 3**: This technique of working in groups to answer questions is designed to get you to discuss the material with your peers, which is a great way to learn for many. How did it help you understand the material? Explain.

- **Post-class reflection:** *Remember that the Post-class reflection should be a summary reflection on the course material learned that day. It should be formally written with yourself, your classmates and your professor as the audience.* Reflect on the day’s activities and discussions in your Fieldpad. What did you learn? Explain.

#### Day 2 Homework

1. Read [I tried 70+ best AI tools in 2025](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-ai-tools), and then choose 2 or 3 of these AI tools that you have never used before and give them a try.
